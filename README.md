#LinkedIn Web Scrapper

The purpose of this code is to allow you can enter a string, similar to what you would search on any job board and it will output a CSV file with multiple columns including the postion title, the company, the location of the company and more!

The code is set to search for "Data Analyst" roles. Make sure to change the string in the scrape_and_save_jobs function at the end to what you would like to scrap for.

Because job boards have different policies and programs to detect and block scrappers, if the code is ran multiple times in a small time frame, you may encounter outputs that will autofill columns with ***'s and only about 6 rows of data instead of the 60 fully filled rows like the example.
