# This is an updated verison of my web scrapper code for LinkedIn 


# By running this code you can enter a string, similar to what you would search on any job board and it will output a CSV file with multiple columns including the postion title, the company, the location of the company and more!


# The code is set to search for "Data Analyst" roles. Make sure to change the string in the scrape_and_save_jobs function at the end to what you would like to scrap for.
